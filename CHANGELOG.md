## Changelog
Not a "proper" versioned changelog, just a list of the changes from Minestom master.
Some of these are pending, some deserve PRs, others are just minor tweaks

* Delete extensions (`mworzala/Minestom` @ `no_more_extensions`)
* Block face in digging events (`mworzala/Minestom` @ `block_break_face`)
* Add cursor position to block place and neighbor updates (`Moulberry/Minestom` @ `block_placement_rewrite_2`)
* Change `Entity#getInstance` to @UnknownNullability
